## Development

The wallet is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and uses [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

  "list": [
    {
      "name": "MyTezosNode",
      "type": "TEZOS",
      "url": "https://mytezosnode.com/",
      "apiKey": "anapikey"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyConseilNode",
      "type": "CONSEIL",
      "url": "https://myconseilnode.com/",
      "apiKey": "anotherapikey"
    }
  ]
}

```
