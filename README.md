# Tezori - A whitelabel wallet framework for Tezos

## Overview

Tezori is a whitelabel wallet framework for the [Tezos](https://tezos.com) blockchain. 

Most notably, Tezori is used for deploying the [Galleon wallet](https://cryptonomic.tech/galleon.html). 

The main branch for the third generation of the project is `trunk`. The current generation is actively under development and therefore at an early stage right now. 

For the first generation of the product, see the `main` branch. For the second generation, see the [T2](https://github.com/Cryptonomic/T2) repo.

Tezori is built using Node.js, React.js and Typescript.
