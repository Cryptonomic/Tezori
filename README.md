[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Cryptonomic/Tezori.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Cryptonomic/Tezori)

## Development

The wallet is built on [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and uses [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

Active development happens on the develop branch with periodic merges to master.

Add the file `extraResources/defaultWalletNodes.json` with your Tezos and Conseil nodes:

```json

  "list": [
    {
      "name": "MyTezosNode",
      "type": "TEZOS",
      "url": "https://mytezosnode.com/",
      "apiKey": "anapikey"
    },
    {
      "name": "MyConseilNode",
      "type": "CONSEIL",
      "url": "https://myconseilnode.com/",
      "apiKey": "anotherapikey"
    }
  ],
  "selectedPath": "Default",
  "pathsList": [
    {
      "label": "Default",
      "derivation": "44'/1729'/0'/0'/0'"
    }
  ]
}

```
